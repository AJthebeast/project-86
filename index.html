Link for your fabric.js, style sheet, js file(put this just before the body tag ends, the same way as did in class) , bootstrap links.
Copy fabric.js file from the class where you had downloaded fabric.js file from google drive in class 86.
Then have a body tag, give it a class, so using this class in CSS you can give background to the HTML page.
And add HTML elements to hold the width and height label
Add canvas.
And try to make your page look like the first image on this document.
For all the HTML code you can refer to the class 86 HTML code, as similar things you have done there.
